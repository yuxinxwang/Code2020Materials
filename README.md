# Code2020Materials

This repository will contain all of the materials for the 2020 Erd&#337;s Institute
C&#337;de Boot Camp.

The material needed for each day of the course will be added the day before it
is covered.

As we go through the material what we cover will be updated below.

On this day we:
<ul>
  <li>Show how to handle time series data in python,</li>
  <li>Learn three basic time series forecasting techniques,</li>
  <li>Introduce lag plots, autocorrelation, and correlograms,</li>
  <li>Adapt cross-validation for time series data, and</li>
  <li>begin on exponential smoothing.</li>
</ul>

### Day 6 - Time Series 2 and Classification 1
The lecture materials are Time Series Notebook 4 and 5 as well as Classification Notebooks 1-3.

On this day we:
<ul>
  <li>Reviewed the End of Exponential Smoothing,</li>
  <li>Went through ARIMA,</li>
  <li>Discussed the goals of classification problems,</li>
  <li>Learned our first simple classification algorithm knn,</li>
  <li>Introduced stratified train test splits, and</li>
  <li>Demonstrated the Logistic Regression algorithm.</li>
</ul>

### Day 7 - Classification 2
The lecture materials are Classification Notebooks 4-6.

On this day we:
<ul>
  <li>Cleared up any lingering questions on Logistic Regression,</li>
  <li>Introduced Decision Trees,</li>
  <li>Saw how we can combine many decision trees into a random forest,</li>
  <li>Learned about some short comings of the sklearn tree based methods with
  regards to categorical data.</li>
</ul>

### Day 8 - Classification 3
The lecture materials are Classification Notebooks 7 and 8.

Today we:
<ul>
  <li>Reviewed support vector machine algorithms,</li>
  <li>Expanded upon our ensemble method techniques with:
    <ul>
      <li>Voter Methods,</li>
      <li>Bagging and Pasting, and</li>
      <li>Boosting.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

### Day 9 - Unsupervised Learning 1
The lecture materials are What's Different With Unsupervised Learning, and Unsupervised
Learning Notebooks 1 and 2.

We:
<ul>
  <li>Introduced the goal of Unsupervised learning techniques,</li>
  <li>Reviewed an array of clustering algorithms including:
    <ul>
      <li>k Means Clustering,</li>
      <li>Hierarchical Clustering, and</li>
      <li>DBScan,</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Described two Clustering practice problems.</li>
</ul>

### Day 10 - Unsupervised Learning 2
The lecture materials are Unsupervised Learning Notebook 3, Proper Data Preprocessing
Steps, and potentially the beginning of Unsupervised Learning Notebook 4.

We:
<ul>
  <li>Discussed the desire to perform dimensionality reduction,</li>
  <li>Introduced Principal Components Analysis and derived the mathematical technique,</li>
  <li>Showed how to interpret the output of PCA,</li>
