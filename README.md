This repository will contain all of the materials for the 2020 Erd&#337;s Institute
C&#337;de Boot Camp.

The material needed for each day of the course will be added the day before it
is covered.

As we go through the material what we cover will be updated below.

## Material Covered

All the lecture materials can be found in the Lectures/DataGathering Folder.
We'll be working through Notebooks 1 - 4 in that folder.

On this day you'll do this following.
<ul>
  <li>Work through a pandas refresher,</li>
  <li>Be introduced to some popular data websites,</li>
  <li>Go through an introduction to html scraping with beautifulsoup,</li>
  <li>Learn the fundamentals of relational databases in python.</li>
</ul>


### Day 2 - Regression 1
All the lecture materials can be found in the Lectures/Regression Folder.
On this day we'll complete notebooks 1 and 2, then start notebook 3.

On this day we'll:
<ul>
  <li>Introduce Regression,</li>
  <li>Learn about Statistical Learning,</li>
  <li>Start with Simple Linear Regression,</li>
  <li>Touch on SLR assumptions,</li>
  <li>Begin Multiple Linear Regression.</li>
</ul>

### Day 3 - Regression 2
The lecture materials for this day are notebooks 3 and 4 in the Regression folder.

We:
<ul>
  <li>Discuss regression models with multiple features,</li>
  <li>Introduce cross validation as a model selection tool,</li>
  <li>Talk about interactions,</li>
  <li>Include polynomial and other nonlinear transformations in our regressions.</li>

### Day 4 - Regression 3
The lecture materials are the end of notebook 4, notebook 5, and notebook 6 in the
Regression Folder.

On our final regression day we:
<ul>
  <li>Show sklearn preprocessing tools and tricks,</li>
  <li>Discuss overfitting and multicolinearity,</li>
  <li>Introduce the Bias-Variance Trade-Off in light of regression,</li>
  <li>Learn about regularization with ridge and lasso,</li>
  <li>See how we can use lasso for feature selection.</li>
</ul>

### Day 5 - Time Series 1
The lecture materials are Notebooks 1, 2, 3, and potentially 4 in the Time Series
folder.

On this day we:
<ul>
  <li>Show how to handle time series data in python,</li>
  <li>Learn three basic time series forecasting techniques,</li>
