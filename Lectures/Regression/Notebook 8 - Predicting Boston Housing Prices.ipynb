    "Now is your chance to put it all together. There'll be no lecturing in this notebook. After you run the code to load in the data you're up.\n",

    "There are some data cleaning techniques you'll need for this notebook that we did not explicitly touch on in our lectures. Feel free to follow along with Notebook 7 - Predicting California Housing Prices, as you work through this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, you may want to look at how to make more sophisticated pipelines than what we've done up to this point. In Notebook 7 we detail how to make a proper pipeline for transforming numerical and categorical data, up to this point we've only dealt with one or the other in our pipelines.\n",

    "Your goal is to take the given features and predict the Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's, this is denoted as `MEDV` in the data and stored in `y` below. In the code chunk with `print(boston['DESCR'])` you can read through a description of the data to get a sense of the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try to build a model with the lowest root average mean square error over a cross-validation split. Feel free to use any of the techniques we've covered up to this point, but nothing else. It's okay if you don't finish this in class or even in one sitting. The point is to expose you to a somewhat realistic modeling process."
