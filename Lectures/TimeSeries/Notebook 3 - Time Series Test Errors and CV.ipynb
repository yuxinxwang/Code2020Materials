    "# Time Series Test Errors and Cross-Validation\n",

    "<q>Prediction is very difficult, especially if it's about the future.</q>\n",
    "\n",
    "--Nils Bohr, Nobel laureate in Physics \n",
    "\n",
    "This quote reiterates what we've said about making predictions in the regression material. We can make a model that is very good at fitting the data we have but there is no guarantee that model does well on unseen data (the future in time series).\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, before introducing more time series forecasting models we'll quickly review how we can adjust the way we compute test errors and perform cross validation. These techniques allow us to attempt to find a model that predicts well.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You'll Accomplish\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular you'll:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>Compute test errors for the average and na&iuml;ve methods on the marathon data,</li>\n",
    "    <li>Learn about the differences for cross-validation,</li>\n",
    "    <li>Perform cross-validation on the measles data to compute the best method among the average, na&iuml;ve and, seasonal na&iuml;ve methods</li>\n",

    "Although we are working with time series data, the error measures we use will still be MSE and RMSE. \n",

    "\n",
    "Let $T$ be the length of the entire time series, $T_{\\text{train}}$ be the length of the training set, let $y_t$ be the target value observed at time $t$, and assume you have some algorithm that produces a prediction, $\\hat{y}_t$ at time $t$.\n",

    "### Horizons\n",
    "\n",
    "The <i>horizon</i> of your model is how far out you'd like to predict. For example:\n",

    "    <li>A model that predicts next quarter's earnings has a horizon of $1$ quarter,</li>\n",
    "    <li>Predicting monthly cases of influenza in 2021 would be a model with a horizon of $1$ year or $12$ months,</li>\n",
    "    <li>A model predicting daily mileage in July 2020 would have a horizon of $1$ month or $31$ days.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "Your desired forecasting horizon (how far out into the future you'd like to predict) should determine how large your test set is.\n",

    "Return to the `marathon` data. We'd like to see if we could predict out the winning times over the next $5$ years.\n",

Then we use the first eight points to predict on the next $4$. Our final split uses the first $12$ points to predict on the last $4$.\n",

For example, if you use cv to see how well your model predicts $1$ time step forward, but then you actually use that model to predict out $4$ time steps forward you shouldn't be shocked if your predictions don't go too well.\n",
