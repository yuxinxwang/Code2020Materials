    "Many of your at home projects can probably be accomplished with one or two data files in csv, json, or table format. However, if you go to work in industry, your company may store its data in some sort of <i>relational database</i>. You may have heard terms like `SQL` server before. Before we get into specifics let's watch this 5 minute tutorial video on what a database is, and why we might like to use one.\n",

    "As the video says databases are ubiquitous in industry, so knowing how to handle them is important. If you're serious you could learn how to program directly in `SQL`,  <i>the Structured Query Language</i>. This is the standard language for relational databases. `SQL` is how you can talk to a database and find the data you need. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the focus of our course is `python` we're lucky that python offers a couple of ways to interact with databases both in the base python packages with `sqlite3` (`python`'s built in SQLite driver), and with an additional package `sqlalchemy` (the `python` `SQL` toolkit and Object Relational Mapper that gives application developers the full power and flexibility of `SQL`). If you installed python via the anacondas distribution you should have `sqlalchemy` installed. If not you'll need to install it before we the end of the notebook. "

Again this may be sufficient for personal projects, but industries are probably other dialects like PostgreSQL, MySQL, or Oracle for various reasons.
